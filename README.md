# AlienSitingsSearch

### Automatic Table and Date Search

* Create a basic HTML web page.

* Using the ufo dataset provided in the form of a JavaScript object, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

  * Make sure you have a column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment` at the very least.

* Using multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns: 

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`

* Write code that will paginate the table (client-side pagination) and only display a maximum set number of results at a time (e.g. 50 results per page).Write code to handle page changes and calculate the number of results which should appear on each page.
